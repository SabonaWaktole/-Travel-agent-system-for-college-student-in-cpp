# C++ Travel Agent System

This is a complete C++ project that implements concepts of **classes**, **objects**, and almost all major **data structures**. The program models a travel management system, handling various aspects of booking flights, hotels, and managing general travel information.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- README.md: Documentation for the project.
- database.txt: Stores database information for the project.
- destinations.txt: Contains information about travel destinations.
- flight.txt: Stores data related to flights.
- generalclass.h: Header file containing class definitions and declarations.
- hotels.txt: Contains data for hotel bookings.
- main.cpp: Main program file where the logic is implemented.
- name of student.txt: Contains details about the project author(s).
- puthere.txt: Placeholder file, possibly for additional resources or instructions.

## 📖 How It Works
- Flight Management:
  Handles flight-related data (e.g., booking, cancellations, details storage in flight.txt).
- Hotel Management:
  Manages hotel bookings stored in hotels.txt.
- Destination Information:
  Displays and stores travel destination details in destinations.txt.

The program ensures a real-life simulation of travel management with clear modularity and an intuitive user experience.
